# translation-service-node

A translation service application using Node.js. This application includes three main functionalities:
1. Fetching locale information based on a specified language (lng) and namespace (ns) from the route "/locales/:lng/:ns.json", and responding with JSON data from the database.
2. Providing a user interface for selecting a translation key, editing its value in different languages, and saving these edits to the database.
3. Importing translation data from a JSON file into the database.

The application aims to simplify the process of managing translations for multi-language projects, enabling easy updates and imports of translation data.
